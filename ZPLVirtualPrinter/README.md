A lightweight utility that allows previewing ZPL labels directly inside Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations without requiring local virtual printer installation.

## 📌 Overview

Testing ZPL labels in D365FO often requires installing local virtual printers or using external tools.  
This utility simplifies the process by:

- Capturing the raw ZPL generated by the system
- Rendering a preview using the Labelary API
- Storing label history for debugging and validation

⚠️ This solution is intended for **development and testing environments only**.
